Ana Britannica Ansiklopedisi was produced by Ana YayÄ±ncÄ±lÄ±k in collaboration with EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, and was first published on November 5, 1986 in Turkey. It was released in 64-page installments over four years. It followed the content structure and organization of the 15th edition of the EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, but also included original articles by Turkish scholars and experts .
  
The encyclopedia aimed to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date source of information for Turkish readers, covering not only universal knowledge but also Turkish culture, history, and society. It also featured illustrations, maps, charts, tables, and photographs to enhance the presentation of information. It was praised for its accuracy, clarity, and objectivity by critics and readers alike.
  
Ana Britannica Ansiklopedisi was one of the first encyclopedias to be published in Turkey, and it faced some challenges such as censorship, distribution difficulties, and competition from other sources of information. However, it also received support from the Turkish government, educational institutions, and media outlets. It sold over 100,000 copies and became a popular reference work for many Turkish households, schools, and libraries.
  
In 1992, Ana YayÄ±ncÄ±lÄ±k published a revised and updated edition of Ana Britannica Ansiklopedisi, which consisted of 22 volumes and a supplementary index volume. The new edition incorporated the latest developments and discoveries in various fields of knowledge, as well as new articles on Turkish topics.

It also included additional content such as dictionaries, atlases, timelines, and quizzes. The electronic edition was compatible with Windows and Macintosh operating systems.
  
In 2001, Ana YayÄ±ncÄ±lÄ±k merged with DoÄan YayÄ±n Holding, one of the largest media conglomerates in Turkey. The merger gave Ana Britannica Ansiklopedisi access to a wider distribution network and a larger customer base. It also enabled the encyclopedia to benefit from the resources and expertise of other DoÄan YayÄ±n Holding subsidiaries, such as HÃ¼rriyet Gazetecilik ve MatbaacÄ±lÄ±k, Milliyet Gazetecilik ve YayÄ±ncÄ±lÄ±k, and DoÄan Kitap.
