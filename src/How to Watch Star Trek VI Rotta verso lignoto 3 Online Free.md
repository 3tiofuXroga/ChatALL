The plot of Star Trek VI - Rotta verso l'ignoto 3 revolves around a conspiracy to sabotage the peace talks between the Federation and the Klingons. The movie begins with a massive explosion on the Klingon moon Praxis, which causes an ecological disaster on the Klingon homeworld Qo'noS. The Klingon Chancellor Gorkon (David Warner) decides to seek peace with the Federation, as his people have only 50 years of life left. He contacts Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner), who is reluctant to trust the Klingons, as they killed his son David in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock.
 
Kirk and his crew are assigned to escort Gorkon's ship to Earth for the peace conference. However, things go wrong when a series of torpedoes that seem to come from the Enterprise hit the Klingon ship and kill Gorkon. Kirk and Dr. Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley) beam over to help, but they are arrested and tried for the assassination. They are sentenced to life imprisonment in the harsh penal colony of Rura Penthe. Meanwhile, Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and the rest of the crew try to find out who is behind the conspiracy, which involves a rogue faction of Starfleet officers, Klingon hardliners and a mysterious shape-shifter named Lt. Valeris (Kim Cattrall).
 
The movie culminates in a thrilling showdown at Khitomer, where the peace conference is held. Kirk and McCoy escape from Rura Penthe with the help of a Klingon prisoner named Martia (Iman), who turns out to be the shape-shifter working for the conspirators. They are rescued by Spock and the Enterprise, who have discovered that Valeris is also part of the plot. They manage to expose the traitors and prevent another assassination attempt on Gorkon's daughter Azetbur (Rosanna DeSoto), who has become the new Klingon leader. The movie ends with Kirk and his crew returning to Earth for their retirement, while quoting Shakespeare and reflecting on their friendship.
